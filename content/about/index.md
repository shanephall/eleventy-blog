## Since 2009, the foundation has been supporting the Hillsdale community

*   Organizing community events
    
*   Supporting local schools and community institutions

We are supported by generous, and grateful, community members through donations, bequests, and volunteerism. Read on and contact us to learn how you can become part of the change we want to see in Hillsdale.

## History

In early 2006, The Hillsdale Alliance, an informal organization of representatives from a coalition of Hillsdale civic groups, decided to establish the non-profit Hillsdale Community Foundation. To fund it, Alliance volunteers began the Hillsdale Book Sale, selling thousands of books donated by the community. The first sale was in the summer of 2006. Over the years, each sale has raised thousands for the Foundation.

The Foundation itself was launched in 2009 when it began making grants for community projects. In early 2011, the Foundation contributed to and managed the three-year-long Hillsdale Main Street program, using matching funds from the City of Portland. Main Street led the community to undertake numerous improvement projects in the commercial “Hillsdale Town Center.”

Starting in 2014, the Foundation board made grants of approximately $5,000 annually to individuals and organizations requesting funds for qualifying community undertakings.

In 2018, our focus changed to community building by supporting events that bring people together. We want you to love Hillsdale as much as we do!
